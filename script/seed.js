Chele recognizes that these infrastructure improvements will create jobs, promote the stateâ€™s long-term economic health and ease the crushing burden placed on property taxpayers. Chele Chiavacci Farley was inspired by her parents to work hard, succeed and help others. Cheleâ€™s father was a scientist who encouraged her to study math, science and engineering.
